     For these data, the training materials typically use:

     library(tidymodels)
     
     set.seed(4595)
     data_split <- initial_split(ames, strata = "Sale_Price")
     ames_train <- training(data_split)
     ames_test  <- testing(data_split)
     
     set.seed(2453)
     ames_folds<- vfold_cv(ames_train)
